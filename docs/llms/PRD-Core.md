# Product Requirements Document - Core

*Last Updated: June 8, 2025*

## üìñ How to Use This Document

### For AI Agents
This is the **core PRD** - your primary reference for project overview, objectives, and development workflow. For architectural constraints, refer to `PRD-Architecture.md`. For detailed technical specifications, refer to `PRD-Technical-Specs.md`.

**Checkbox Management:**
- `[ ]` = Task not started
- `[x]` = Task completed  
- Update checkboxes as you progress through tasks
- Never mark a checkbox complete without actually implementing the feature
- Use checkboxes to track your progress across multiple sessions

**Workflow Adherence:**
1. Use the ./llms/llms.txt file as an entry point for discovering technical constraints and for context on the packages used.
2. Always follow the 6-step workflow (Plan ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Complete)
3. Never skip the "Analyze" step - constraint violations are project failures
4. Reference the appropriate technical documents during analysis
5. Check the architecture guide before implementing any patterns

## üéØ Project Vision

### Primary Purpose
A **revolutionary web development platform** that demonstrates a new paradigm for creating websites by:
- Using Babylon.js 3D engine as the primary rendering system
- Storing content as structured JSON instead of HTML/CSS
- Translating JSON data into 3D-rendered layouts and interactive experiences
- Serving as both a technical demonstration and personal portfolio platform

### Evolution Timeline
1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Technical demonstration + personal portfolio
2. **Phase 2 (Medium-term)**: GUI website builder for custom site creation
3. **Phase 3 (Long-term)**: 3D/VR social network with immersive profile sites

### Core Innovation
**Reinventing the web stack** by replacing HTML/CSS with JSON + 3D rendering:
- Freedom from HTML/CSS backwards compatibility constraints
- Enhanced aesthetic possibilities (animations, shaders, mini-games)
- Scraping protection through canvas-based rendering
- Consistent rendering regardless of browser standard changes

## üë• Target Users

### Primary Audience
**Creative professionals and individuals** seeking unique portfolio/profile sites:
- Developers showcasing technical skills
- Artists wanting rich visual presentations
- Anyone seeking creative expression beyond traditional web limitations

### User Journey
1. **Phase 1**: Clone repository ‚Üí Run on personal server ‚Üí Explore demo site
2. **Phase 2**: Sign in ‚Üí Use GUI builder ‚Üí Design custom site ‚Üí Publish
3. **Phase 3**: Create 3D/VR profile spaces ‚Üí Social networking in immersive environments
